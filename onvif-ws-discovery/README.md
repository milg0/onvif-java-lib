# JavaWsDiscovery
This is an extreme simple WS-Discovery hack for Java without any dependencies to discover Onvif device addresses and
others on local networks.
Looking around for WS-Discovery implementations I found java-ws-discovery and apache-cxf, please look there if you need
fully equipped SOAP implementations.
Please feel free to add notes, suggestions and whishes or devices not responding or small success notes: Yeah, device xy
is responding.
If your device is not detected, please send a network recording of your UDP traffic.

Please check my modifications to https://github.com/thhart/onvif-java-lib if you want to use it for Onvif management.
